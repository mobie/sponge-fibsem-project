# Sponge Fibsem MoBIE Project

This project contains the FIB-SEM data, and derived segmentations, from [Profiling cellular diversity in sponges informs animal cell type and nervous system evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/758276v1.abstract).
It contains three data-sets:
- `cell1`: High resolution FIB-SEM of neuroid cell
- `cell2`: High resolution FIB-SEM of neuroid cell (different cell than `cell1`)
- `choanocyte-chamber`: FIB-SEM of complete choanocyte chamber, including choanocytes, apopylar cells and two neuroid cells
